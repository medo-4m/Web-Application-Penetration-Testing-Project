Project 2: "Web Application Penetration Testing"
Objective: Perform penetration testing on a web application to identify and exploit common vulnerabilities like SQL Injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

Week 1: Information Gathering and Reconnaissance
  Task: Gather information about the target web application using passive reconnaissance techniques (OSINT).
  Deliverables: Reconnaissance report detailing target technologies, potential entry points, and exposed data.

Week 2: Vulnerability Identification and Exploitation
  Task: Identify common vulnerabilities (SQLi, XSS) and exploit them using tools like Burp Suite and SQLMap.
  Deliverables: Proof-of-concept exploitation for identified vulnerabilities, including screenshots and detailed attack vectors.
Week 3: Automated and Manual Testing
  Task: Use automated tools (e.g., OWASP ZAP) for vulnerability scanning and perform manual testing for business logic flaws.
  Deliverables: Detailed report on automated and manual findings, prioritized by severity.
Week 4: Reporting, Remediation Recommendations, and Presentation
  Task: Document vulnerabilities, provide remediation recommendations, and prepare a presentation to present findings to stakeholders.
  Deliverables: Comprehensive web application security report, including detailed steps for remediation. Final presentation summarizing the vulnerabilities, exploits, and suggested remediations.
